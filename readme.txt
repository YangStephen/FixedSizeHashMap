Hi There!

Thanks for taking a look at my implementation of the FixedSizeHashMap. I thought I'd make your life a bit simpler and
add in the commands you will need to execute the code.

From the Root Folder, Execute this to run it from the command line!

javac HashMapSimulator.java
java HashMapSimulator

Best,
Stephen.
